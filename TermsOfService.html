            <br>
            <h3><strong>7. 263STORES Payments</strong></h3>
            <p>
                The 263STORES Payments system means that payment for items on the Site may be made online or partly online through the 263STORES payment facilities 
                which 263STORES makes available on the Site.

                By providing these payment facilities, 263STORES is merely facilitating the making of online payments by buyers possible but 263STORES is not 
                involved in the process of buying and selling items on the Site. All sales and purchases on the Site continue to be bipartite contracts between 
                the buyer and the seller of an item(s) and 263STORES is not responsible for any non-performance, breach or any other claim relating to or arising 
                out of any contract entered into between any buyers and sellers, nor does 263STORES have any fiduciary duty to any user.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>8. Pricing Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>
                All prices are inclusive of VAT (where applicable) at the rate appropriate to the country of receipt, and are correct at the time of entering 
                the information on to the system. Prices may change and offers may be withdrawn at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although we try to ensure all our prices displayed on our website are accurate, errors may sometimes occur. If we discover an error in the price 
                of an item you have ordered we will contact you as soon as possible. You will have the option to reconfirm your order at the correct price or cancel it. 
                If we are unable to contact you, we will treat your order in respect of the incorrectly priced item as cancelled.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>9. Delivery</strong></h3>
            <p>
                All goods will be delivered by a carrier and will require a signature on delivery. If you are out when the carrier attempts to deliver your parcel, 
                they will leave a card with a contact number for you to arrange a new delivery date. Proof of identification will be required on delivery. Deliveries are made Monday to Saturday.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will make every effort to facilitate the delivery of goods within the estimated timescales. However delays are occasionally inevitable due to unforeseen 
                factors or events outside our control, for example extreme weather, a flood or fire. 263STORES shall be under no liability for any delay or failure to deliver 
                the products within estimated timescales as we are merely facilitating the process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Risk of loss and damage of products passes to you on the date when the products are delivered to you. We will notify you of the delivery cost during the checkout period.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>10. Order Cancellation</strong></h3>
            <p>
                If, for any reason, you wish to cancel any order you have placed before it has been delivered or been made available for collection you can cancel the order yourself 
                in the My Account section of the website or contact <a href="contact-us.html">263stores Customer Service</a> team. As it is our policy to try to process orders immediately 
                it may not always be possible to stop an order from being dispatched. After dispatch our Returns Policy will apply. Please note that your right to return goods does not apply to certain products.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are unable to accept order cancellations for personalised, perishable or time critical goods. Please see the following list for some non-exhaustive examples:
            </p>

            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3><strong>11. Return Policy</strong></h3>
            <p>
                Please note that <strong>not all products are returnable and not all shops will accept returns.</strong> Each product will be labelled if our return policy applies or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                To claim refund or exchange any item you are not completely happy with, contact us though our customer service email or our available phone lines elaborating the product name, receipt number, 
                and reason of return within 48hours of the item being delivered to your nominated address or collected. 263STORES will forward the request to the shop the product was purchased. If a return

            </p>
            <p>
                This does not apply to faulty or incorrectly supplied goods where your statutory rights are unaffected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where lingerie, swimwear, cosmetics and earrings are protected by hygiene seals, you are required to take reasonable care by not removing the hygiene seals. Refunds will not be provided in such circumstances unless the goods are faulty.
            </p>
            <p>
                Where promotional discounts are applied to orders, the discount will be applied to each item in the basket. In the event of a return, you will not be refunded the discounted proportion. 
                Additionally any complimentary promotional gift given with an order must also be returned if you are returning those goods to which the gift related.
            </p>
            <p>
                263STORES, its officers, employees, agents, affiliates shall not be liable if the store from which you purchased a product fails to return any goods as we are only facilitating the process.
            </p>
            <br>

            </p>
            <p><strong>withdraw your access to the Site:</strong></p>
            <ul class="list-group">

                263STORES may at any time at its sole discretion reinstate suspended users. A user that has been indefinitely suspended or had their membership withdrawn may not register or attempt to register with 263STORES or use the Site in any manner whatsoever until such time that

                legal action and/or the initiation of criminal proceedings against you as 263STORES in its sole discretion deems necessary. Our failure to act with respect to a breach by you or others does not constitute a waiver of 263STORES's right to take any actions with respect to that, 
                or subsequent or similar breaches. 263STORES does not guarantee that it will take action against all breaches that there may be of this User Agreement.

            <h3><strong>19. Providing Feedback</strong></h3>
            <p>
                263STORES encourages buyers and merchants on the Site to provide feedback on each other's conduct after a transaction has closed; as this helps all users know what it is like to deal with the said buyer/seller. Your feedback will be displayed along with your user ID on the Site. 
                You cannot retract the feedback once you have left it. 263STORES will not be responsible or liable in any way for the feedback that you post on the Site. You agree not to make comments that are not factual in nature including without limitation making any racist comments, 
                using profanity, abusing another user, disrespecting another culture or any other derogatory or inappropriate comments. You further agree not to post feedback in order to solicit sales outside of the Site and not to display contact information of any person within any feedback. 
                If you continuously receive negative feedback ratings, without prejudice to any other rights and remedies of 263STORES under this User Agreement or at law, 263STORES reserves the right to suspend, limit or withdraw your access to the Site and/or your membership of the Site.
            </p>
            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that your feedback consists of comments left by other users with whom you transact and a composite feedback number compiled by 263STORES, and that together these convey your full user profile. As feedback ratings are not designed for any purpose other 
                than for facilitating trading between the users, you agree that you shall not market or export your 263STORES feedback rating in any venue other than on the Site. 263STORES does not provide the technical ability to allow you to import feedback from other websites to the Site 
                because a composite number, without the corresponding feedback does not reflect your true online reputation within our community.
            </p>

            <h3><strong>20. Withdrawal of Access and/or Membership</strong></h3>
